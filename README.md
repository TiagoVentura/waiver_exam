## Overview of the exam

This exam provides an overview of all topics covered in PPOL 5203.  The exam is formed by one question from each problem set assigned at PPOL 5203. 

If you feel confident answering the questions, you should be fine waiving the course. If you feel there are topics here you are struggling with, I suggest you register for the course. My experience is that we often learn new things by taking similar courses multiple times.
